Hi, welcome to my project.
The big basic concept behind this is that a player need to go through the rooms, find the appropriate item and bring to the right room to win 
(help the injured man to recall his accident).
My project contain 11 rooms (10 rooms and 1 hall - this is where the player can win), and 7 items. Each room, I assigned items. 
The user can pick any items they like. However, there are 2 special  items: a torch, to change the state of two rooms - closet and stair; 
and a big hammer, to break down the wall in the hall to let the player wins.
I create an inventory for the players, allow them to take, drop, use them. However, take and use command can only process in specific places in the game.
For the room, I allow the player to go back and forth between them.
I use multiple pointers, malloc, and free() in my program. And catch some invalid cases within the game like invalid input, 
or the person does not have the item, or the direction the user is heading too is NULL.

You have to use UMass email to see it.

Thank you so much,
